      Keypads handle a user entering a PIN and arming disarming an alarm system or entering a panic mode.  The keypad should also display the current state of the Security Alarm Subsystem in some manner, either through LEDs or sound alerts.

         However it may be set manually in case the keypad is no longer in sync with the security system.  In this case the
         keypad should avoid making transition noises (such as the armed or disarmed beeps).  However if the state is
         ARMING, SOAKING, or ALERTING and the associated sounds are enabled it should beep accordingly.
