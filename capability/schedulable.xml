   <c:description>
   Capability for denoting what type of scheduling a device supports.  To maintain backwards
   compatibility before this capability was added, any device that is typically schedulable should
   be considered as such when this capability is not present.

NOT_SUPPORTED:  No scheduling is possible either via Iris or the physical device
DEVICE_ONLY:  Scheduling is not possible via Iris, but can be configured on the physical device
DRIVER_READ_ONLY:  Iris may read scheduling information via a driver specific implementation but cannot write schedule information
DRIVER_WRITE_ONLY:  Iris may write scheduling information via a driver specific implementation but cnnot read schedule information
SUPPORTED_DRIVER:  Iris may completely control scheduling of the device via a driver specific implementation (i.e. schedule is likely read and pushed to the device)
SUPPORTED_CLOUD:  Iris may completely control scheduling of the device via an internal mechanism (i.e. cloud or hub based)
